# Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS - ud304
##What this class was all about
In this class, I learned HTML and CSS by building web pages, my own framework, and taking advantage of the popular Bootstrap framework. I learned how to build a responsive portfolio site with the functionality to add my future projects to it using my own CSS framework. Most importantly, I gained an understanding of how the DOM and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all relate to each other.  
I was able to practice taking several website mock ups from 0 to fully working website.
  
##Why I took this course
Front-end Web Developers must have a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS, which I accomplished in this course by converting digital design mockups into static web pages. To build the web pages I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, the popular Twitter CSS framework.

After completing this course I am now able to build a responsive portfolio site with my own CSS framework. I also have the functionality in place to add future projects to my portfolio. Most importantly, I have an understanding of the DOM and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript relate to each other.

##Course Summary
HTML and CSS are markup languages and the building blocks that make up the web. This course is called "Not your Typical Intro" because it does not follow the usual pattern of other courses and tutorials that you find on the Internet. Usually HTML and CSS are taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer.  

In this course I learned how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. I learned how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.  

Also, I learned about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.  

## Course Final Proect 
###How do I Complete this Project?  
  Here's what you should do:  
1. Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section to your lower right hand corner and review it.  
2. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.  
3. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.  
4. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.  
5. Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:  
* HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.  
* CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).  

##Course Syllabus
###Lesson 1 - From Design to Code

Diligently employed a code/test/refine strategy as I precisely and deliberately translated initial design documents into static web pages. I also investigated the Document Object Model (DOM) and its implications for web development.

###Lesson 2 - Your Own Framework

Took pride in creating and personalising my own multi-platform, responsive CSS framework for publishing my professional portfolio projects to the web.

###Lesson 3 - Learning and Using Bootstrap

Strategically investigated an existing professional CSS framework as I used it to build a website using responsive design principles while maintaining code readability.
