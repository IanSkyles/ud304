# Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS - ud304
##What this class was all about
In this class, I learned HTML and CSS by building web pages, my own framework, and taking advantage of the popular Bootstrap framework. I learned how to build a responsive portfolio site with the functionality to add my future projects to it using my own CSS framework. Most importantly, I gained an understanding of how the DOM and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all relate to each other.  
I was able to practice taking several website mock ups from 0 to fully working website.
  
##Course Summary
HTML and CSS are markup languages and the building blocks that make up the web. This course is called "Not your Typical Intro" because it does not follow the usual pattern of other courses and tutorials that you find on the Internet. Usually HTML and CSS are taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer.  

In this course I learned how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. I learned how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.

Also, I learned about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.
