# Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS - ud304
##What this class was all about
In this class, I learned HTML and CSS by building web pages and taking advantage of the popular Bootstrap framework. I learned how to build a responsive portfolio site with the functionality to add my future projects to it using my own CSS framework. Most importantly, I gained an understanding of how the DOM and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all relate to each other.
